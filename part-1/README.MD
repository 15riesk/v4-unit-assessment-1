# DevMountain Web - Skills Check 1 Part 1

Part 1 of the skills check will consist of two mockups which you will need to re-create using HTML & CSS. You should recreate these as closely as possible using the HTML layout and CSS tools that you have learned so far. They will likely challenge you but you have all of the tools necessary to recreate them.
